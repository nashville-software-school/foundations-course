## Using Claude Effectively

You will be coached on how to use Claude effectively throughout your learning journey. Here are some general tips to get you started:

* As a beginner, you never want to ask Claude to generate any code for you. Instead, ask Claude to explain the concepts behind the code.
* Ask Claude to explain programming concepts in simple terms
* Use Claude to help you debug your code
* Ask Claude for best practices and coding standards
* Ask Claude for recommendations on learning resources
* Ask for explanations when you don't understand something

Remember that while Claude is a powerful tool for learning, it's important to:
* Verify information from multiple sources
* Practice writing code yourself rather than just copying solutions
* Use Claude as a learning aid, not a replacement for hands-on coding practice`,
