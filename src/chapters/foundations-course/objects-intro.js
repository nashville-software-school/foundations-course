  content: `## Representing Life as Objects

Software developers are paid to represent real-world things and processes in code. To represent things like people, tools, animals, flowers, businesses, and financial transactions, we use objects.

You can identify an object in JavaScript by a series of properties surround by curly braces \`{\` and \`}\`. Here's a simple object that represents this chapter.

\`\`\`js
const objectsIntro = {
  site: "repl.it",
  classroom: "Objects",
  chapter: "Introduction and Syntax",
  audience: "Beginners",
  minutesToComplete: 4.25
}
\`\`\`

A property on an object is comprised of a key and a value. You can think of them just like declaring a variable, but the syntax is slightly different, and the variable is now grouped together with other ones in the context of the object.

\`\`\`js
// Regular variable declarations
const firstName = "Michael"
const lastName = "McLenton"
const age = 25
const city = "Nashville"

// Same variables scoped to an object
const michael = {
  firstName: "Michael",
  lastName: "McLenton",
  age: 25,
  city: "Nashville"
}
\`\`\`

You've replaced the \`=\` sign with a colon \`:\` for assigning a value to a variable. When a variable is defined this way - in the scope of an object - it's called a property. The variable name is now now called a key. The value is still called value.

Here is an example of representing a book as an object in JavaScript.

\`\`\`js
const book = {
  title: "Where the Wild Things Are",
  isbn: "0-06-025492-0",
  publisher: "Harper & Row",
  publicationDate: "1963",
  pages: 40
}
\`\`\`

You can put as many properties on an object as you need to appropriately describe that object, and what you need to display to people who are viewing the information.

## Exercise: Your First Object

In the code editor, you will see some starter code. You only need to focus on the following code.

\`\`\`js
/* Create your student object here */
const student =
\`\`\`

After the \`student = \`, your job is to create an object that represents a new student who is learning how to write software. The student should have the following properties.

* A name property with a value of "Jeremy Landy"
* A location property with a value of "Phoenix, AR"
* A gender property with value of "male"
* An age property with a value of 31

So you need the curly braces, and the properties. Leave the rest of the code unchanged.`,
  exercise: {
    starterCode: `/* Create your student object here */
const student = `,
    solution: `/* Create your student object here */
const student = {
    name: "Jeremy Landy",
    location: "Phoenix, AR",
    gender: "male",
    age: 31
}`,
    tests: [
      {
        name: "Object Creation",
        test: (code) => code.includes('{') && code.includes('}'),
        message: "Make sure you're creating an object with curly braces"
      },
      {
        name: "Name Property",
        test: (code) => code.includes('name:') && code.includes('"Jeremy Landy"'),
        message: "Make sure you have a name property with the correct value"
      },
      {
        name: "Location Property",
        test: (code) => code.includes('location:') && code.includes('"Phoenix, AR"'),
        message: "Make sure you have a location property with the correct value"
      },
      {
        name: "Gender Property",
        test: (code) => code.includes('gender:') && code.includes('"male"'),
        message: "Make sure you have a gender property with the correct value"
      },
      {
        name: "Age Property",
        test: (code) => code.includes('age:') && code.includes('31'),
        message: "Make sure you have an age property with the correct value"
      }
    ]
  }
}
