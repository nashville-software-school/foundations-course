  content: `## Complex Objects That Contain Other Objects

Data structures can get even more complex when you are working with objects. Consider a dog and her favorite toy. You can represent the dog and the toy seperately.

\`\`\`js
const gypsy = {
    name: "Gypsy",
    age: 5,
    breed: "Schnauzer",
    weight: 25
}

const favoriteToy = {
    brand: "Hasbro",
    name: "Mean Kitty",
    price: 8.99
}
\`\`\`

You can also make the toy a property of the dog itself.

\`\`\`js
const gypsy = {
    name: "Gypsy",
    age: 5,
    breed: "Schnauzer",
    weight: 25,
    favoriteToy: {
        brand: "Hasbro",
        name: "Mean Kitty",
        price: 8.99
    }
}
\`\`\`

You have an object contained within the scope of another object. To access the \`price\` property for the favorite toy, you have use the dot \`.\` character twice.

\`\`\`js
const toyPrice = gypsy.favoriteToy.price
\`\`\`

If you want the age of the dog, you only need one dot.

\`\`\`js
const dogAge = gypsy.age
\`\`\`

Again, to access the brand of the toy, you need two dots in order to get to the nested object.

\`\`\`js
const toyBrand = gypsy.favoriteToy.brand
\`\`\`

## Practice: Sales Associate Email

You work for a car dealership, and you want to get the email address of each sales associate. In the starter code provided, return the email address of the sales associate.`,
  exercise: {
    starterCode: `const salesAssociate = {
    firstName: "Rachel",
    lastName: "Martinez",
    contact: {
        phone: "123-456-7890",
        email: "rachel.martinez@dealership.com",
        address: "123 Car Street"
    }
}

// Add your code here to get the email address`,
    solution: `const salesAssociate = {
    firstName: "Rachel",
    lastName: "Martinez",
    contact: {
        phone: "123-456-7890",
        email: "rachel.martinez@dealership.com",
        address: "123 Car Street"
    }
}

const associateEmail = salesAssociate.contact.email
console.log(associateEmail)`,
    tests: [
      {
        name: "Object Property Access",
        test: (code) => code.includes('.contact.email'),
        message: "Make sure you're using dot notation to access the nested email property"
      },
      {
        name: "Variable Assignment",
        test: (code) => code.includes('=') && code.includes('salesAssociate.contact.email'),
        message: "Make sure you're assigning the email address to a variable"
      }
    ]
  }
}
