# Github

GitHub is a platform where developers store and manage their code. Having a professional GitHub account is crucial for your career as a software developer.

## Steps to Create Your Account

1. Think of a **professional username** to use for Github:
    * Use your real name or a variation of it (e.g., jsmith, john-smith)
    * Avoid usernames that sound unprofessional or juvenile
    * Keep it simple and memorable
    * Examples of good usernames:
        * johnsmith
        * john-smith
        * jsmith-dev
        * johnsmith-dev
2. Visit <a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">GitHub's signup page</a> to create your account.

3. Use a professional email address:
    * Preferably use a personal email rather than a work or school email
    * This ensures you maintain access to your account even if you change jobs or graduate

4. Choose a secure password:
    * Use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols
    * Make it at least 12 characters long
    * Don't reuse passwords from other accounts

5. Verify your account:
    * Complete any verification steps GitHub requires
    * This might include solving a puzzle or verifying your email

6. Set up your profile:
    * Add a professional photo
    * Include your full name
    * Write a brief bio describing your professional interests
    * Add your location
    * Consider adding your LinkedIn profile

## Best Practices

* Keep your profile professional and active
* Start following relevant organizations and developers
* Begin contributing to open-source projects when you're ready
* Use your GitHub account to showcase your work and learning progress

Remember, your GitHub profile often serves as a portfolio and can be viewed by potential employers. Keep it professional and maintain it regularly.`,
