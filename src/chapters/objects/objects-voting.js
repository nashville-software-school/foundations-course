In this exercise, you are going to access some nested object properties, and practice adding properties. Then you will use string interpolation to display the name, location, and manager of a voting booth location.

### Step 1

In the starter code provided, add a new property to the booth object after it is created. Do not modify the original object.

* Property name should be \`manager\`
* Property value should be "Abigail Brown"

### Step 2

Use string interpolation to return the following string from the function. Remember to use the backticks and \`\${}\` to inject variables into the string.

"Abigail Brown manages the Commonwealth Community Center at 70 Main Street in Nashville, TN"
