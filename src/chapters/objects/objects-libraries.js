In this exercise, you are going to practice accessing properties on nested objects again. Remember that for each nested object, you need to use the dot \`.\` character to access it.

\`\`\`js
const flower = {
    color: "Yellow",
    species: {
        name: "Tulip",
        rare: false,
        idealCondition: {
            shade: false,
            dailyWater: true,
            clay: false,
            soil: true
        }
    },
    price: 1.29,
    arrangements: ["Birthday", "Mother's Day"]
}
\`\`\`

If you want to check if the ideal condition for a flower includes growing it in clay, you would write the following code.

\`\`\`js
console.log(flower.species.idealCondition.clay)

> false

## Practice: Librarian and Book Author

The starter code contains a book object that has properties for the book's ISBN, title, author, and checked-in status. The author property is an object itself, containing the author's first and last name. The checked-in property is also an object, containing the date and librarian information.

Your task is to access the author's last name and the librarian's last name using dot notation. The variables \`bookAuthor\` and \`checkedInBy\` are already declared for you, but they are not assigned any values yet.
