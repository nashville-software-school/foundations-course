In preparation for when you are going to be contructing HTML representations of your data to be displayed in a web browser, you are going to be constructing some strings in this chapter that contain the \`<article>\` element, with the text from each note contained _(interpolated)_ inside it.

# ðŸ“°Practice: Display Notes as HTML Articles

Youâ€™ve listed topics and filtered notes. Now Leonid wants to wrap each noteâ€™s text in an HTML \`<article>\` element. Itâ€™s not going on the web â€” just good practice!

1. Start by printing this header: \`console.log("***  Note Articles  ***");\`
2. Use a for...of loop to go through the notes array.
3. In each loop, use console.log() to print the text of the note wrapped in an HTML-style article tag, like this:
\`<article>Note text here</article>\`
