## Instructions

Now that you have an array filled with a good number of note objects, it's time to list all of the notes to the terminal.

Iterate the array with a \`for..of\` loop and use \`console.log()\` to display **only** the \`text\` property of each object - not the full object.

# Prectice: List Only the Text from Each Note

Use a \`for...of\` loop and \`console.log()\` to display only the \`text\` property of each note in the \`notes\` array.

Now you need to **print only the \`text\` properties values** to the terminal.

1. Use a \`for...of\` loop to iterate through the \`notes\` array  
2. In each loop iteration, use \`console.log()\`  
3. Log only the \`text\` property â€” do **not** log the entire object

## ðŸ’¡ Example Output

When your code runs, it should print lines like:

"Discussed pricing strategy with Leonid." "I have found that slowing down and thinking about the problem..." "Need to have all my code backed up to Github by the end of the week."
