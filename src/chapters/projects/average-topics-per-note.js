    content: `## Practice: Calculate average

Calculate and display the **average number of topics** used across all notes.

You already have a \`notes\` array where each note has a \`topics\` array. 
Your task is to:

1. Count the **total number of topics** across all notes
2. Count the **number of notes**
3. Calculate the **average topics per note**
4. Use \`console.log()\` to print the results

### âœ… Your output should start with this line:
*** Average Topics Per Note ***

Then log the **average as a number**, rounded to one decimal place (e.g., \`2.0\` or \`2.3\`).
## ðŸ’¡ Example Output
*** Average Topics Per Note *** 2.0
