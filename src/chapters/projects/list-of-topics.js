Now that you have listed all of the notes, you need to list all of the topics that have been used to describe the notes.

## Instructions

In this chapter you will need to write a \`for..of\` loop inside of another one since the topics on each note is an array as well.

## Practice: Notes Topics display

Each note in your \`notes\` array contains a \`topics\` property, which is an array of strings. 
Your goal is to:

1. Print the header line exactly as \`*** All Note Topics ***\`
2. List topics each on it's own line. The order of topics should follow the order of the notes and the order of topics within each note.
