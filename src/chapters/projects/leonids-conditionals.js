  # Finding an Item in an Array

> Now that you have a basic catalog that Leonid can see in the terminal, he has a request. He wants to be able to find a single product by providing the unique \`id\` property. Your code should then display the details of the phone which has the specified \`id\` value.

## If Inside For Loop

Your phone shop is getting popular these days. You have expanded your offerings and now you need the ability to have customers use a terminal in your store to find the information about a particular phone.

They come into your store after looking at your catalog, and should be able to enter in the unique \`id\` of a phone and then be shown all the details.

You are going to simulate this by specifying the \`id\` that you want to find at the very top of your code.

\`\`\`js
const phoneToFind = 2
\`\`\`

Next, you need to modify the \`for..of\` loop to only display the product details if a condition is true. In your code, that condition is if the current phone's \`id\` value matches the value of the \`phoneToFind\` variable's value.

\`\`\`js
for (const phone of phones) {
    // Only one phone will cause the condition below to evaluate to true
    if (phone.id === phoneToFind) {
        phone.weight = phone.weight + 0.4
        console.log(\`The \${phone.maker} \${phone.name} costs \${phone.price} dollars. It weighs \${phone.weight} grams.\`)
    }
}
\`\`\`

With that condition in place, only one phone will be displayed instead of all phones.

for the phone weight format the number rouded to decimal place!
