  content: `## Using the Length of an Array

Arrays have a \`.length\` property that tells you how many items are in the array.

## Rainfall

You can perform whatever task you want inside a for loop. In the previous exercises, you have used the \`.push()\` methods to build up a new array based on the items in another array. Here is an example of building up a total value.

A meterologist wants to determine what the total rainfall for a year was, and then calculate the average rainfall per month.

\`\`\`js
const rainfallPerMonth = [ 5, 12, 18, 20, 22, 17, 29, 21, 20, 22, 30, 9 ]
let totalRainfall = 0  // Start at 0 and add to it in the loop

for (const rain of rainfallPerMonth) {
  totalRainfall += rain
}

// To find the average, you take the total and divide by the number of items
const averageRainfall = totalRainfall / rainfallPerMonth.length

console.log(\`Total rainfall was \${totalRainfall} inches
Average rainfall was \${averageRainfall} inches
\`)
\`\`\`

Put that code into the code editor and run it to see the output.

## Exercise: Grocery Shopper

In this exercise, you will write code to calculate your average monthly grocery expenses. So far, you have collected five months' worth of expenses.`,
  exercise: {
    starterCode: `const monthlyExpenses = [ 201, 189, 132, 238, 195 ]
let totalExpense = 0

for (const xxx of xxx) {
  // Add the current monthly cost to the value of totalExpense
}

// Calculate your average monthly food costs
const averageExpense =

// Replace the --- with the correct, interpolated values
console.log(\`My total expenses are --- and my average monthly expenses are ---\`)`,
    solution: `const monthlyExpenses = [ 201, 189, 132, 238, 195 ]
let totalExpense = 0

for (const expense of monthlyExpenses) {
  totalExpense += expense
}

// Calculate your average monthly food costs
const averageExpense = totalExpense / monthlyExpenses.length

console.log(\`My total expenses are \${totalExpense} and my average monthly expenses are \${averageExpense}\`)`,
